    return `Great question about PAL! Our Personalized Adaptive Learning system is truly revolutionary. Here's how it works: when students answer questions correctly, they advance to the next concept and earn points. But when they get something wrong, PAL doesn't just mark it incorrect - it identifies the underlying misconception and provides easier questions on prerequisite concepts.

For example, if a student struggles with quadratic equations, PAL might take them back to linear equations or even basic algebra until they master those foundations. This ensures every student builds solid understanding before moving forward. Teachers love it because they can see real-time analytics showing exactly where each student is in their learning journey!

Would you like to know more about how teachers use the analytics dashboard, or are you curious about the student experience?`

    return `I'd be happy to help you with lesson planning! Mentora AI's Contextual Lesson Generation is one of our most popular features. Simply enter your topic, grade level, and any specific context about your class, and our AI creates comprehensive lesson plans tailored to your needs.

The best part? You can push these lessons directly to Google Classroom with PAL enabled, so students get personalized question paths based on their understanding. Teachers report saving 10+ hours per week on lesson prep! The AI considers curriculum standards, learning objectives, and even suggests differentiation strategies for different learner needs.

Try clicking on the "Lesson Plan" tool in your dashboard - it's the one with the book icon. What subject are you planning to teach?`

Our Smart Assessment Creator doesn't just generate random questions - it creates contextual questions perfectly aligned to learning gaps and curriculum standards. You can specify the number of questions, difficulty level, and question types (multiple choice, open-ended, or both).

Once you create a quiz, you can push it to Google Classroom where PAL takes over. Students who answer correctly move forward, while those who struggle get immediate feedback and remedial questions on prerequisite concepts. Teachers get real-time analytics showing misconceptions as they happen - no more waiting for test results!

The system has helped schools achieve an average 23% improvement in test scores. Would you like me to walk you through creating your first quiz?`

    return `Our Real-Time Learning Analytics are a game-changer for teachers! Instead of waiting weeks for test results, you can see exactly how each student is performing right now. The dashboard shows individual progress, identifies struggling students, and even highlights specific misconceptions.

The AI provides actionable insights like "4 students are struggling with linear equations - consider reviewing basic algebraic manipulation" or "Sarah is ready for advanced topics in polynomials." Teachers can intervene immediately when students need help, rather than discovering problems too late.

You can access the analytics dashboard anytime to see class-wide trends, individual student journeys, and get AI-powered recommendations for next steps. It's like having a teaching assistant that never sleeps!`

The PAL system makes learning feel like a game - they earn points for correct answers and get helpful guidance when they struggle.
